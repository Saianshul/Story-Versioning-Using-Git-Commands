Once upon a time, there was a tortise who challenged a hare to a race.
The hare accepted the challenge, so the race begun.
The hare was way ahead of the tortise, so it got over-confident and took a nap in the middle of the race.
Eventually, the tortise caught up to the hare and passed it without it even noticing because it was fast asleep.
